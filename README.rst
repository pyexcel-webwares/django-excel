Introduction
================================================================================
Here is a typical conversation between the developer and the user::

      User: "I have uploaded an excel file"
            "but your application says un-supported file format"
 Developer: "Did you upload an xlsx file or a csv file?"
      User: "Well, I am not sure. I saved the data using "
            "Microsoft Excel. Surely, it must be in an excel format."
 Developer: "OK. Here is the thing. I were not told to support"
            "all available excel formats in day 1. Live with it"
            "or delay the project x number of days."

**django-excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ and makes
it easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as
well as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists,
a list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it
lets you focus on data in Django based web development, instead of file formats.

The idea behind pyexcel originated from a common usability problem: when Excel-driven
web applications are delivered to non-developer users (e.g., project assistants, human
resources administrators), they often are not aware of the differences
between file formats such as CSV, XLS, and XLSX. Rather than training users on these
formats, pyexcel provides web developers with a unified interface to handle most
Excel file types.


To add support for a specific Excel format in your application, simply install an
additional pyexcel pluginâ€”no code changes required. This eliminates issues with
different file formats. In the broader community, pyexcel and its associated
libraries aim to be a simple, easy-to-install alternative to Pandas, where minimal
data manipulation is needed.

The highlighted features are:

#. excel data import into and export from databases
#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data structure
#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download
#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side
#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via
   the following plugins:

Plugin shopping guide
------------------------

Since 2020, all pyexcel-io plugins have dropped the support for python versions
which are lower than 3.6. If you want to use any of those Python versions, please use pyexcel-io
and its plugins versions that are lower than 0.6.0.


Except csv files, xls, xlsx and ods files are a zip of a folder containing a lot of
xml files

The dedicated readers for excel files can stream read


In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] zipped csv file
.. [#f2] zipped tsv file


This library makes information processing involving various excel files as easy as
processing array, dictionary when processing file upload/download, data import into
and export from SQL databases, information analysis and persistence. It uses
**pyexcel** and its plugins:

#. to provide one uniform programming interface to handle csv, tsv, xls, xlsx, xlsm and ods formats.
#. to provide one-stop utility to import the data in uploaded file into a database and to export tables in a database as excel files for file download.
#. to provide the same interface for information persistence at server side: saving a uploaded excel file to and loading a saved excel file from file system.

Installation
================================================================================

You can install django-excel via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-excel


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel-webwares/django-excel.git
    $ cd django-excel
    $ python setup.py install

Setup
======

You will need to update your *settings.py*:

.. code-block:: python

    FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS = ("django_excel.ExcelMemoryFileUploadHandler",
                            "django_excel.TemporaryExcelFileUploadHandler")



Usage
=========
Here is the example viewing function codes:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
    from django.http import HttpResponseBadRequest
    from django import forms
    from django.template import RequestContext
    import django_excel as excel
    
    class UploadFileForm(forms.Form):
        file = forms.FileField()
    
    def upload(request):
        if request.method == "POST":
            form = UploadFileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
            if form.is_valid():
                filehandle = request.FILES['file']
                return excel.make_response(filehandle.get_sheet(), "csv")
            else:
                return HttpResponseBadRequest()
        else:
            form = UploadFileForm()
        return render_to_response('upload_form.html',
                                  {'form': form},
                                  context_instance=RequestContext(request))
    
    def download(request):
        sheet = excel.pe.Sheet([[1, 2],[3, 4]])
        return excel.make_response(sheet, "csv")

Development guide
================================================================================

Development steps for code changes

#. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel.git
#. cd django-excel

Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:

#. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

Then install relevant development requirements:

#. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
#. pip install -r requirements.txt
#. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Once you have finished your changes, please provide test case(s), relevant documentation
and update changelog.yml

.. note::

    As to rnd_requirements.txt, usually, it is created when a dependent
    library is not released. Once the dependency is installed
    (will be released), the future
    version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.


How to test your contribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is advisable
that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure
the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development
releases.

On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::

    $ make

On Windows, please issue this command::

    > test.bat


Before you commit
------------------------------

Please run::

    $ make format

so as to beautify your code otherwise your build may fail your unit test.
