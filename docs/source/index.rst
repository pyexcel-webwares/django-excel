`django-excel` - Let you focus on data, instead of file formats

Here is a typical conversation between the developer and the user::

 User: "I have uploaded an excel file"
       "but your application says un-supported file format"
 Developer: "Did you upload an xlsx file or a csv file?"
 User: "Well, I am not sure. I saved the data using "
       "Microsoft Excel. Surely, it must be in an excel format."
 Developer: "OK. Here is the thing. I were not told to support"
            "all available excel formats in day 1. Live with it"
            "or delay the project x number of days."

**django-excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ and makes
it easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as
well as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists,
a list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it
lets you focus on data in Django based web development, instead of file formats.

The idea originated from the common usability problem: when an excel file
driven web application is delivered for non-developer users (ie: team assistant,
human resource administrator etc). The fact is that not everyone knows (or cares)
about the differences between various excel formats: csv, xls, xlsx are all
the same to them. Instead of training those users about file formats, this
library helps web developers to handle most of the excel file
formats by providing a common programming interface. To add a specific excel
file format type to you application, all you need is to install an extra pyexcel
plugin. Hence no code changes to your application and no issues with excel file
formats any more. Looking at the community, this library and its associated ones
try to become a small and easy to install alternative to Pandas.


The highlighted features are:

#. excel data import into and export from databases
#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data structure
#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download
#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side
#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via
   the following plugins:

Plugin shopping guide
------------------------

Since 2020, all pyexcel-io plugins have dropped the support for python versions
which are lower than 3.6. If you want to use any of those Python versions, please use pyexcel-io
and its plugins versions that are lower than 0.6.0.


Except csv files, xls, xlsx and ods files are a zip of a folder containing a lot of
xml files

The dedicated readers for excel files can stream read


In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] zipped csv file
.. [#f2] zipped tsv file


This library makes information processing involving various excel files as easy as
processing array, dictionary when processing file upload/download, data import into
and export from SQL databases, information analysis and persistence. It uses
**pyexcel** and its plugins:

#. to provide one uniform programming interface to handle csv, tsv, xls, xlsx, xlsm and ods formats.
#. to provide one-stop utility to import the data in uploaded file into a database and to export tables in a database as excel files for file download.
#. to provide the same interface for information persistence at server side: saving a uploaded excel file to and loading a saved excel file from file system.


Given the existence of pyexcel, what is the reason for django-excel?
1. **Speedy file uploads**.  **django-excel** help you access the uploaded excel file directly using ExcelMemoryFileUploadHandler and TemporaryExcelFileUploadHandler. MemoryFileUploadHandler holds the uploaded file in memory and django-excel reads the excel data from this memory buffer without caching it onto file system. Meanwhile, TemporaryExcelFileUploadHandler holds the uploaded file in file system and django-excel reads directly from this stream-to-file without extra function calls.
2. **Import excel data into database**. **django-excel** uses bulk_insert to import your excel
data into your django Model, which is very efficient.

Installation
-------------------


You can install django-excel via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-excel


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel-webwares/django-excel.git
    $ cd django-excel
    $ python setup.py install

Installation of individual plugins , please refer to individual plugin page. For example, if you need xlsx file support, please install pyexcel-xlsx::

        $ pip install pyexcel-xlsx

Contrary to Django's philosophy of 'battery included', django-excel does not
come with all batteries due to the size of the dependency(xlwt, openpyxl, odfpy). Hence,
Django developer is left with the choice to install and load the excel file formats.

Setup
------------------------

You will need to update your *settings.py*:

.. code-block:: python

    FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS = ("django_excel.ExcelMemoryFileUploadHandler",
                            "django_excel.TemporaryExcelFileUploadHandler")





Tested Django Versions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1, 2.08, 1.11.15, 1.10.8, 1.9.13, 1.8.18, 1.7.11, 1.6.11

Since 15 March 2015, python 2.6 are no longer tested via travis-ci.

the project and develop it further.

If you are an individual, you are welcome to support me too and for however long
you feel like. As my backer, you will receive
`early access to pyexcel related contents <https://www.patreon.com/pyexcel/posts>`_.

And your issues will get prioritized if you would like to become my patreon as `pyexcel pro user`.

With your financial support, I will be able to invest
a little bit more time in coding, documentation and writing interesting posts.



More excel file formats
------------------------

The example application understands csv, tsv and its zipped variants: csvz and tsvz. If you would like to expand the list of supported excel file formats (see :ref:`file-format-list`) for your own application, you could install one or all of the following::

    pip install pyexcel-xls
    pip install pyexcel-xlsx
    pip install pyexcel-ods

.. warning::

   If you are using pyexcel <=0.2.1, you still need to import each plugin manually, e.g. `import pyexcel.ext.xls` and
   Your IDE or pyflakes may highlight it as un-used but it is used. The registration of
   the extra file format support happens when the import action is performed

Tutorial
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to dive in django-excel and get hands-on experience quickly, the test
application for django-excel will be introduced here. So, it is advisable that
you should check out the code from
`github <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel>`_ ::

    git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel.git

The test application is written according
to `Part 1 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/>`_,
`Part 2 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/>`_ and
`Part 3 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial03/>`_ of django
tutorial. If you should wonder how the test application was written, please
visit django documentation and come back.

Once you have the code, please change to django-excel directory and then
install all dependencies::

    $ cd django-excel
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Then run the test application::

    $ python manage.py runserver
    Performing system checks...

    System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

    You have 9 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes.
    Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.


.. note::

   The 9 unapplied migration(s) were ignored because migrations are out of scope in this
   tutorial.

Handle excel file upload and download
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example shows how to process uploaded excel file and how to make data
download as an excel file. Open your browser
and visit http://localhost:8000/polls/, you shall see this upload form:

.. image :: upload-form.png

Choose an excel sheet, for example an xls file, and press "Submit". You will get a csv file for download.

.. image :: download-file.png

Please open the file
`polls/views.py <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/polls/views.py#L14>`_
and focus on the following code section:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 14-36


**UploadFileForm** is html widget for file upload form in the html page. Then
look down at **filehandle**. It is an instance of either ExcelInMemoryUploadedFile
or TemporaryUploadedExcelFile, which inherit ExcelMixin and hence have a list of
conversion methods to call, such as get_sheet, get_array, etc.

For the response, :meth:`~django_excel.make_response` converts
:class:`pyexcel.Sheet` instance obtained via
:meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.get_sheet` into a csv file for download.

Please feel free to change those functions according to :ref:`the mapping table <data-types-and-its-conversion-funcs>`.


Handle data import
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example shows how to import uploaded excel file into django models. We are
going to import
`sample-data.xls <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/sample-data.xls>`_

.. pyexcel-table:: ../../sample-data.xls

into the following data models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/models.py
   :lines: 4-

.. note::
   Except the added "slug" field, **Question** and **Choice** are copied from Django tutorial part 1.

.. note::
   Please also pay attention to 'choice' sheet. There exists an arbitrary column: "Noise", which
   exists to show case skipping column feature using mapdicts later.

Please visit this link http://localhost:8000/polls/import/, you shall see this upload form:

.. image:: import-page.png

Please then select
`sample-data.xls <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/sample-data.xls>`_
and upload. And you get the following excel-alike table in response to confirm all were imported.

.. image:: handsontable-question.png

.. image:: handsontable-choice.png

.. note ::

   pyexcel-handsontable along with pyexcel v0.5.0 brings excel-alie table rendering feature.
   Let me explain how this view is done a few paragraphs later.

Then visit the admin page http://localhost:8000/admin/polls/question,
you shall see questions have been populated:

.. image:: question-admin.png

.. note::
   The admin user credentials are: user name: admin, password: admin

And choices too:

.. image:: choice-admin.png

You may use admin interface to delete all those objects and try again.

Now please open `polls/views.py <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/polls/views.py#L79>`_
and focus on this part of code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 72-92

The star is :meth:`~django_excel.save_book_to_database`. The parameter **models**
should be a list of django models. **initializers** is a list of initialization
functions for each model. In the example, we do not have init function for Question
so 'None' is given and `choice_func` is given to Choice. **mapdicts** is a list of
column names for each model and the member of the **mapdicts** can be a dictionary::

    {
      "Question Text": "question_text",
      "Publish Date": "pub_date",
      "Unique Identifier": "slug"
    }

As a dictionary, it can be used to skip columns in the incoming sheets. For example,
'Noise' column is skipped because it was not mentioned in the mapdict.

The custom initialization function is needed when the data from the excel sheet
needs translation before data import. For example, **Choice** has a foreign
key to **Question**. When choice data are to be imported, "Question" column
needs to be translated to a question instance. In our example, "Question" column
in "Sheet 2" contains the values appeared in "Unique Identifier" column in
"Sheet 1".


Handle data export
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section shows how to export the data in your models as an excel file. After
you have completed the previous section, you can visit
http://localhost:8000/polls/export/book and you shall get a file download dialog:

.. image:: download-dialog.png

Please save and open it. You shall see these data in your window:

.. image:: question-sheet.png
.. image:: choice-sheet.png

Now let's examine the code behind this in
`polls/views.py <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/polls/views.py#L48>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 49-56


:meth:`~django_excel.make_response_from_tables` does all what is needed: read out
the data, convert them into xls and give it the browser. And what you need to do
is to give a list of models to be exported and a file type. As you have noticed,
you can visit http://localhost:8000/polls/export/sheet and will get **Question**
exported as a single sheet file.


Render an excel-alike html in a browser
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In previous section, you have seen the rendering of the excel-alike table. First of
all, the credits goes to `handsontable developers <https://handsontable.com/>`_.
`pyexcel-handsontable`_ as renderer plugin to pyexcel v0.5.0 bring it to
pyexcel developers.

Here is how it is done. Simply put in 'handsontable.html' instead of 'xls' as
file type.

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 153-155

It is understood that you will want to embed it into your django templates.
Here are the sample embedding code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 158-189

Those views can be accessed as http://localhost:8000/polls/embedded_handson_view/
and http://localhost:8000/polls/embedded_handson_view_single/.

.. image:: handsontable-embedded.png


How to import one sheet instead of multi-sheet book
********************************************************************************

Previous example shows how to import a multi-sheet book. However, what exactly is
needed to import only one sheet instead? Before you proceed, please empty question
and choice data using django admin.

Let's visit this url first http://localhost:8000/polls/imports_sheet/, where you
see a similar file upload form. This time please choose
`sample-sheet.xls <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/sample-sheet.xls>`_
instead. Then look at django admin and see if the question data have been
imported or not.

Now let's look at the code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 104-116

Because it is a single sheet, the function to call is
:meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.save_to_database` where you specify a model and
its mapping dictionary.

Have you noticed the extra parameter 'name_columns_by_row'? Why is this needed?
Well, normally you *will not need* that if you have column names in the first row.
In this example, the column names appears in the second row. Please open
`sample-sheet.xls <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/blob/master/sample-sheet.xls>`_
and have a look. The straight answer is because the column names in the data
appears in the 2nd row of the data matrix.

.. note::

   If you have imported earlier excel sheet "sample-data.xls", you will get the
   following warning in your console output::

       Warning: Bulk insertion got below exception. Trying to do it one by one slowly.
       column slug is not unique <- reason
       One row is ignored <- action
       column slug is not unique
       What is your favourite programming language?
       One row is ignored
       column slug is not unique
       What is your favourite IDE?


   This is because question data have been imported before. Django is raising
   IntegrityError. For more details please read
   `this part of code in pyexcel-io <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-io/blob/master/pyexcel_io/djangobook.py#L98>`_,
   and `django-excel issue 2 <https://github.com/pyexcel/django-excel/issues/2>`_

   In order to remove those warnings, what you can do is to empty all data using
   django admin and redo this single sheet import again.


What to do if import data overlaps existing data in the database
********************************************************************************

With new version pyexcel-io v0.1.0, you could provide the row initialization
function that returns None in order to skip a row in your import data. Inside
the initialization function, you could also do database update. As long as it
returns None, django-excel will try to do bulk create the import data.


Handle custom data export
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is also quite common to download a portion of the data in a database table,
for example the result of a search query. With version 0.0.2, you can pass on a
query sets to to :meth:`~django_excel.make_response_from_query_sets` and generate
an excel sheet from it:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 49, 56-65

You can visit http://localhost:8000/polls/export/custom and will get the query
set exported as a single sheet file as:

.. image:: custom-export.png


Visualize your data
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's go to the admin page and update some votes for the choices.

.. image:: admin-vote.png

In my case, I have updated all of them and have gotten something like this:

.. image:: votes-handson-table.png

Now, let's look at the survey result(http://localhost:8000/polls/survey_result/)
for "What's your favorite IDE?":

.. image:: survey-result.png

`pyexcel-pygal`_ provide you the common data visualization capability to show
your data intuitively. Here is the code to achieve that:

.. literalinclude:: ../../polls/views.py
   :lines: 192-217

API Reference
---------------

**django-excel** attaches **pyexcel** functions to **InMemoryUploadedFile** and **TemporaryUploadedFile**. Hence, the following functions are available for the uploaded files, e.g. request.FILES['your_uploaded_file'].

.. module:: django_excel.ExcelMixin

.. method:: get_sheet(sheet_name=None, **keywords)

   :param sheet_name: For an excel book, there could be multiple sheets. If it is left
                      unspecified, the sheet at index 0 is loaded. For 'csv', 'tsv' file,
                      *sheet_name* should be None anyway.
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.get_sheet`
   :returns: A sheet object

.. method:: get_array(sheet_name=None, **keywords)

   :param sheet_name: same as :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.get_sheet`
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.get_array`
   :returns: a two dimensional array, a list of lists

.. method:: iget_array(sheet_name=None, **keywords)

   :param sheet_name: same as :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.get_sheet`
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.iget_array`
   :returns: a generator for a two dimensional array, a list of lists

.. method:: get_dict(sheet_name=None, name_columns_by_row=0, **keywords)

   :param sheet_name: same as :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.get_sheet`
   :param name_columns_by_row: uses the first row of the sheet to be column headers by default.
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.get_dict`
   :returns: a dictionary of the file content

.. method:: get_records(sheet_name=None, name_columns_by_row=0, **keywords)

   :param sheet_name: same as :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.get_sheet`
   :param name_columns_by_row: uses the first row of the sheet to be record field names by default.
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.get_records`
   :returns: a list of dictionary of the file content

.. method:: iget_records(sheet_name=None, name_columns_by_row=0, **keywords)

   :param sheet_name: same as :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.get_sheet`
   :param name_columns_by_row: uses the first row of the sheet to be record field names by default.
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.iget_records`
   :returns: a generator for a list of dictionary of the file content

.. method:: get_book(**keywords)

   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.get_book`
   :returns: a two dimensional array, a list of lists

.. method:: get_book_dict(**keywords)

   :param keywords: additional keywords to :func:`pyexcel.get_book_dict`
   :returns: a two dimensional array, a list of lists

.. method:: save_to_database(model=None, initializer=None, mapdict=None, **keywords)

   :param model: a django model
   :param initializer: a custom table initialization function if you have one
   :param mapdict: the explicit table column names if your excel data do not have the exact column names
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :meth:`pyexcel.Sheet.save_to_django_model`

.. method:: isave_to_database(model=None, initializer=None, mapdict=None, **keywords)

   similar to :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.save_to_database`. But it requires
   less memory.

   This requires column names must be at the first row.

.. method:: save_book_to_database(models=None, initializers=None, mapdicts=None, **keywords)

   :param models: a list of django models
   :param initializers: a list of model initialization functions.
   :param mapdicts: a list of explicit table column names if your excel data sheets do not have the exact column names
   :param keywords: additional keywords to :meth:`pyexcel.Book.save_to_django_models`

.. method:: isave_book_to_database(models=None, initializers=None, mapdicts=None, **keywords)

   similar to :meth:`~django_excel.ExcelMixin.save_book_to_database`. But it requires
   less memory.

   This requires column names must be at the first row in each sheets.

.. method:: free_resources()

   It should be called after iget_array and iget_records were used
